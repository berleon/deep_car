# Pixels to Drive

Learning to drive from pixel inputs.
This is the repository for a software project at the Freie Universtit√§t.

# Dependencies

See the `requirements.txt` file.

# Notebooks

Most code is written in Jupyter Notebooks. Here is a short overview. A more
detailed description can be found inside the notebooks.

# Train data collection

For collecting the data we build a little test race circuit. For the first
generation of data we were simply driving the trip manually controlling
the car with the android app. The driving time was about 1 hour. We sticked
to driving in the same direction. In the end we had 3 big files with trainig
data.
For the second generation we placed various obstacles on the driving road.
We used orange soccer balls and some big chess statues. This time we were also
driving in both directions. The driving time was about 1 1/2 hour. Again the 
driving was done manually with the android app. This time we split our trainig
data into many smaller data sets.

Finally we combined the data to create our total test set.

We used the following command for recording the data:

   rosbag record  \
    	/manual_control/speed \
    	/manual_control/steering \
    	/model_car/yaw \
        /deepcar/resize_img80x60/compressed
